If You Are New To Python, you are in the right place! This is my repository of pretty much everything in the basic to intermediate areas of python. From basic syntax, 'strings', (tuples), etc. to databases and dataframes with numpy, pandas, matplotlib and Seaborn. Take a look around, feel free to download these jupyterlab notebooks and I hope they help you along the way! Ask me anything you like. (you may need to put a csv file in your anaconda folder or download one, otherwise, all data comes from basic datasets). 

Keep an eye out for my upgraded handwriting models and basic games. I think a lot of teachers mean well when giving tutorials, but i find a lot of them leave holes in the code for exiting the code or trying again to run it. I will attempt to address these and many other barriers that i feel like those new to programming may face in future uploads. Happy Coding!
